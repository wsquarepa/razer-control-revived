# Changelog

## 0.5.0

- The settings GUI is back as `razer-gui`: an Iced-based neon dashboard with an
  Overview telemetry grid (CPU/GPU usage, watts, fans, temps), the full
  performance/GPU/lighting/battery feature set from the GTK app, and a
  status-notifier tray.
- `install-local.sh` rebuilt for the workspace layout: builds and installs the
  daemon, CLI, GUI, and system assets on any systemd distro, grants the daemon
  the file capability needed for CPU wattage telemetry, migrates pre-workspace
  installs, and gains `--uninstall` / `--purge` modes.

## 0.3.0-rc1 (2026-03-27)

### Bug Fixes

- **KDE Plasma 6: window not receiving focus on Wayland** — On Plasma 6 (Wayland),
  the Razer Settings window would not receive focus or appear in Alt+Tab. Instead it
  showed as "demanding attention" (orange highlight) in the Task Manager widget.
  - **Root cause**: KWin matches windows to desktop entries using the Wayland `app_id`.
    GTK4 sets this to the GApplication ID (`com.encomjp.razer-settings`), but the
    installed desktop file was named `razer-settings.desktop`. KWin could not find
    `com.encomjp.razer-settings.desktop`, so startup notification failed.
  - **Fix**: Renamed desktop file to `com.encomjp.razer-settings.desktop` to match the
    GApplication ID. Added `StartupNotify=true` and `StartupWMClass=com.encomjp.razer-settings`
    for proper window-to-launcher association.
  - Updated all install scripts, CI workflows, packaging (RPM, DEB, AppImage, Nix, tarball).

- **Documentation: git clone URL** — Removed unnecessary `.git` suffix from clone
  commands in README and razer_control_gui README.
